## Contributing
Unlike most others, this documentation framework is minimalist. Piece by piece, additional MDX components are created to make the resulting documentation even more beautiful. However, the goal is to keep this package as simple and clean as possible. This is one of the reasons why I decided against a monorepo/turborepo, as I felt this would be superfluous, especially for the beginning.

I think that everyone should be able to create a visually appealing and well-structured documentation for their SaaS, their open source project or their own package as easily as possible.

But first and foremost, I created Shiori because I needed it.
The existing solutions either didn't satisfy me in various ways or were completely overwhelming for me just to be able to create a small documentation.

So if you have time, desire and ideas that you think would be good for this package, feel free to contribute. ðŸ˜Š
